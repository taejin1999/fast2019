\section{Related Work}
There has been many research that focus on exploiting streams
for multi-streamed SSDs~\cite{MultiStream, Level, vStream, FStream, AutoStream, PCStream}. 

Kang {\it et al.} proposed the multi-stream interface with the manual stream allocation
to separate different data types~\cite{MultiStream}. 
Yang {\it et al.}, furthermore, insisted to separate data
of the same data type, such as different levels of compaction data by 
modifying the RocksDB implementation~\cite{Level}.
Yong {\it et al.} presented virtual stream management to resolve limited number
of streams.
All those studies involve modifying the source code of the target application, leading
to increase deployment effort.
Our PCStream does not require manually modifying the application.

Rho {\it et al.} proposed a stream management technique at the file system layer.~\cite{FStream}
File system metadata and journal are allocated to separate streams.
Moreover, user data are separated based on the file name or file extension.
PCStream, however, is not limted to file system data and
does not require knowledge of file name or file extension.

Yang {\it et al.} presented the automatic stream management technique at the 
block device layer based on the access patterns of address space.
Their work does not work well for the application which has no strong relation
between address and data hotness.
However, our PCStream can work well for general I/O workloads by exploiting 
I/O activities of the application.


Kim {\it et al.} proposed an earlier version of the PCStream idea and 
demonstrated that PCStream can reduce WAF without 
modifying application~\cite{PCStream}. 
Unlike their work, however, our work treats the PCStream approach
in a more complete fashion, extensively extending the PCStream approach
in several dimensions such as the formal organization of the internal stream,
maintaining streams for the past PCs and supporting for indirect writes. 
Furthermore, more realistic and detailed 
evaluations using various applications and a real SSD with internal 
stream support are presented in this paper.
