\section{Related Work}
Kim et al. proposed an earlier version of the PCStream idea and 
demonstrated that PCStream can reduce WAF significantly without 
modifying application~\cite{PCStream}. 
Unlike their work, however, our work treats the PCStream approach
in a more complete fashion, extensively extending the PCStream approach
in several dimensions such as the updating workload support, caching
lifetime for previous PCs. Furthermore, more realistic and detailed 
evaluations using various applications and an SSD with internal 
stream support.
\\
+ comparison with previous stream mangement techniques will be added
