\subsection*{Abstract}
Multi-streamed SSDs
can significantly improve both the performance and lifetime of flash-based SSDs
when their streams are properly managed.  
However, existing stream management techniques do not adequately 
support the multi-streamed SSDs for their wide adoption.
No existing stream management technique works in a {\it fully automatic} fashion 
for {\it general} I/O workloads including modern append-only workloads.  
Furthermore, the limited number of available
streams in multi-streamed SSDs makes it difficult to effectively manage streams 
when a large number of streams are required.
In this paper, we propose a fully automatic stream
management framework which can work efficiently for general I/O workloads.
The propoased technique, PCStream, is based on our observation that data lifetimes 
can be effectively managed at the write program contexts which can works
as a virtual stream.
By extracting program contexts during run time in the kernel, PCStream automates 
the stream mapping task by allocating virtual streams to physical
streams using a clustering method.
In order to overcome a limitation on the number of supported streams, we propose a new 
type of streams, called internal streams, whose implementation is not restricted by 
the SSD-internal hardware resource budget.
We dedicate internal streams only for garbage collection so that streams 
can be further separated based on data lifetimes.
Our evaluations on real SSDs show that PCStream can reduce the write amplification factor 
by up to 58\% for various modern I/O workloads.
