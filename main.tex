\subsection*{Abstract}
Multi-streamed SSDs, when their streams are properly managed, 
can significantly improve both the performance and lifetime of flash-based SSDs.  
However, most existing stream management techniques
require manual stream allocation for a small number of streams, thus making 
a wide adoption of multi-streamed SSDs in practice difficult.  
In this paper, we propose a {\it fully-automatic} stream
management approach which removes the existing major hurdles for multi-streamed SSDs.  
First, we present  an automatic stream management technique, PCStream++, which requires 
no manual coding at all from existing applications.   
PCStream++ is based on our observation that data lifetimes can be reliably predicted
using write program contexts.
By extracting program contexts during runtime, PCStream++ automates the data-to-stream mapping.  
When data mapped to the same stream show large differences in their lifetimes,
PCStream++ separates the long-lived data of the current stream to 
another stream during garbage collection (GC).   
In order to support stream reallocation efficiently during garble collection, 
we propose {\it GC-only streams} for multi-streamed SSDs.   
Taking advantage of its GC-only property, we can increase the number of SSD streams 
significantly by overcoming the existing resource constraint on implementing streams.  
By using GC-only streams, we can easily separate streams with
different lifetimes without affecting the overall performance.    
Our evaluations on real SSDs show that PCStream++ can reduce ...
