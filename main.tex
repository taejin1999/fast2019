\subsection*{Abstract}
Multi-streamed SSDs
can significantly improve both the performance and lifetime of flash-based SSDs
when their streams are properly managed.  
However, existing stream management techniques do not adequately 
support the multi-streamed SSDs for their wide adoption.
No existing stream management technique works in a fully automatic fashion 
for general I/O workloads including append-only workloads.  
Furthermore, the limited number of available
streams makes it difficult to effectively manage streams 
when a large number of streams are required.
In this paper, we propose a {\it fully automatic} stream
management technique, PCStream, which can work efficiently for {\it general} I/O workloads.
PCStream is based on the key insight that stream allocation decisions should be made on 
dominant I/O activities. By identifying dominant I/O activities using program contexts, 
PCStream fully automates the whole process of stream allocation 
within the kernel with no manual work.
In order to overcome the limited number of supported streams, we propose a new 
type of streams, internal streams, which can be implemented at low cost.
With internal streams, which are used only for garbage collection, 
PCStream can effectively double the number of available streams. 
Our evaluations on real multi-streamed SSDs show that PCStream
outperforms highly-optimized manual stream allocations by experienced 
programmers by reducing the garbage collection overhead 
by up to 58\% for various modern I/O workloads.
