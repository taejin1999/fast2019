\section{Conclusions}

We have presented a new stream management technique, \textsf{\small PCStream}, for multi-streamed SSDs.  
Unlike existing stream management techniques, \textsf{\small PCStream} fully automates 
the process of mapping data to a stream based on PCs, 
which work well for append-only workloads as well as update workloads.  
By exploiting an observation that most PCs are distinguishable from each other 
in their lifetime characteristics, \textsf{\small PCStream} allocates each PC to a different stream.  
When a PC has a large variance in their lifetimes, \textsf{\small PCStream} refines its stream allocation 
during garbage collection and moves the long-lived data of the current stream to its substream.  
Our experimental results show that \textsf{\small PCStream} can reduce the average WAF by 35\% over the existing %shane part
automatic technique.

The current version of \textsf{\small PCStream} can be extended in several directions.  
For example, we plan to optimize the PC clustering method so that
multiple PCs can be better clustered when the number of PCs significantly
outnumbers the number of streams.
