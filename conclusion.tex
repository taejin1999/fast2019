We have presented a new stream management technique, \textsf{\small PCStream},
for multi-streamed SSDs.  Unlike existing techniques, \textsf{\small PCStream}
fully automates the process of mapping data to a stream based on PCs.  Based on
observations that most PCs are effective to distinguish lifetime
characteristics of written data, \textsf{\small PCStream} allocates each PC to
a different stream.  When a PC has a large variance in their lifetimes,
\textsf{\small PCStream} refines its stream allocation during GC and moves the
long-lived data of the current stream to the corresponding internal stream.
Our experimental results show that \textsf{\small PCStream} can improve the
IOPS by up to 56\% over the existing automatic technique while reducing WAF by
up to 69\%. 

The current version of \textsf{\small PCStream} can be extended in several
directions.  First, currently, PCStream does not support applications that rely
on a write buffer ({\it e.g.,} MySQL). To address this, we plan to extend
PCStream interfaces so that developers can easily incorporate PCStream into
their write buffering modules with minimal efforts.  Second, we have only
considered \texttt{write()}-related systems calls to collect PCs, but many
applications ({\it e.g.} MongoDB) heavily use the \texttt{mmap()} interface to
access files, . In the future, we plan to extend PCStream to support
\texttt{mmap()}.
