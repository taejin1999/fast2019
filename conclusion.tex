\section{Conclusions}

We have presented a new stream management technique, \textsf{\small PCStream}, 
for multi-streamed SSDs.  
Unlike existing stream management techniques, \textsf{\small PCStream} fully automates 
the process of mapping data to a stream based on PCs, 
which work well for append-only workloads as well as update workloads.  
By exploiting an observation that most PCs are distinguishable from each other 
in their lifetime characteristics, \textsf{\small PCStream} allocates 
each PC to a different stream.  
When a PC has a large variance in their lifetimes, 
\textsf{\small PCStream} refines its stream allocation 
during garbage collection and moves the long-lived data of 
the current stream to the corresponding internal stream.
Our experimental results show that \textsf{\small PCStream} can reduce 
the average WAF by up to 69\% over the existing automatic technique.

The current version of \textsf{\small PCStream} can be extended in several directions.  
For example, we plan to support applications with other types of indirect writes.
